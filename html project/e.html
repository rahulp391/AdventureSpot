<h1>“The best view comes after the hardest climb.”</h1>
</div>

<div class="text" >
<p style="Font-size:26px;">Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Professional rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route.Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. It can be a dangerous activity and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes.</p>
<h2>Types Of Rock Climbing</h2>
<pre>
<h4>1. Aid: </h4>Still the most popular method of climbing big walls, aid climbers make progress up a 
wall by repeatedly placing and weighting gear that is used directly to aid ascent and 
enhance safety.This form of climbing is typically used when ascent is too technically 
difficult or impossible for free climbing.
<h4>2. Free:</h4>The most commonly used method to ascend climbs refers to climbs where the climber's 
own physical strength and skill are relied on to accomplish the climb. Free climbing may 
rely on top rope belay systems, or on lead climbing to establish protection and the belay 
stations. Anchors, ropes and protection are used to back up the climber and are 
passive as opposed to active ascending aids. Subtypes of free climbing are trad clim-
-bing and sport climbing. Free climbing is generally done as "clean lead" meaning no 
pitons or pins are used as protection.
<h4>3. Bouldering:</h4>Climbing on short, low routes without the use of the safety rope that is typical of most 
other styles. Protection, if used at all, typically consists of a cushioned bouldering pad 
below the route and a spotter, a person who watches from below and directs the fall of 
the climber away from hazardous areas. Bouldering may be an arena for intense and 
relatively safe competition, resulting in exceptionally high difficulty standards.
<h4>4. Solo:</h4>Solo climbing, or soloing, is a style of climbing in which the climber climbs alone,
without the assistance of a belay.
<h4>5. Deep-Water solo(DWS):</h4>Deep-water soloing (or psicobloc) is similar to free soloing in that the climber is 
unprotected and without a rope, but should the climber fall, it is into deep water instead 
of onto the ground.
<h4>6. Free Solo:</h4>Free soloing, referred to as "soloing" in the UK, is single-person climbing without the 
use of any rope or protection system whatsoever. If a fall occurs and the climber is not 
over water (as in the case of deep water soloing), the climber is likely to be killed or 
seriously injured. Though technically similar to bouldering, free solo climbing typically 
refers to routes that are far taller and/or far more lethal than bouldering. The term 
"highball" is used to refer to climbing on the boundary between free soloing and bould-
-ering, where what is usually climbed as a boulder problem may be high enough for a 
fall to cause serious injury (20 ft. and higher) and hence could also be considered to be 
a free solo.
<h4>7. Roped Solo:</h4>Solo climbing with a rope secured at the beginning of the climb allowing a climber to 
self-belay as they advance. Once the pitch is completed the soloist must descend the 
rope to retrieve their gear, and then reclimb the pitch. This form of climbing can be 
conducted free or as a form of aid climbing.
