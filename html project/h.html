<h1>“Skydivers are people who enjoy falling down.”</h1>
</div>

<div class="text" >
<p style="Font-size:26px;">Skydiving is parachuting from an airplane for fun. Skydiving can be done individually and with groups of people. Training is required. Unlike most paratroopers, skydivers often wait until they are low, before opening the parachute. The jump can also be made from a helicopter or a balloon that is high enough in the sky. Skydiving can be an exciting sport.
Skydiving includes free falling (usually from an aeroplane) through the air prior to opening a parachute. Typically skydives are carried out from around 4,000m (or 12,500ft) offering 40 to 50 seconds of freefall time. </p>
<h2>Types of Skydiving</h2>
<pre>
<h4>1. Standard Skydiving: </h4>Often known as ‘fun jumps’, a standard skydive is a purely recreational experience 
done for the rush of free fall and majestic views while soaring to the ground. There are 
plenty of skydiving clubs around where you can meet like-minded people and share the 
cost of jumping.
<h4>2. Tandem Skydiving:</h4>As mentioned, this is the kind of jump you’ll do when strapped to the instructor, either 
as a ‘fun jump’ or as part of your training. Initially your instructor will handle all the 
technical aspects of jumping but as you gain more experience you will start to take on 
some of this responsibility until you are ready to make a solo jump.
<h4>3. Formation Jumping:</h4>This is also known as ‘relative work’ and involves a number of experienced skydivers 
falling to earth with the belly facing down. During freefall they attempt to build 
formations in the air, using movement skills and by holding on to each other’s arms and 
legs. Formations can number from two-ways to groups numbering in the hundreds.
<h4>4. Freeflying:</h4>TThis is a form or aerial acrobatics that involves building a series of formations in a mix 
of upright and head-down orientations. Jumpers fly under, over and around each other 
in a pre-planned patterns. Vertical formation skydiving is another variation of freeflying.
<h4>5. Wingsuit Flying:</h4>One of the newest and most exciting types of skydiving, and one that is attracting the 
most attention. A wingsuit is a specially designed, aerodynamic jumpsuit that uses 
fabric to create wings between the arms and legs of the jumper. This means they can 
cover large distances horizontally and even  ‘fly’ very close to the ground.
<h4>6. Canopy Formation:</h4>Also known as ‘canopy relative work’, this is formation skydiving that takes pace after 
the chute has opened. Because of this the jumpers open their chutes the moment 
they leave the plane to give maximum time for canopy work.
