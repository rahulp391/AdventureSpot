<p style="Font-size:26px;">Snowboarding is a recreational activity and Winter Olympic and Paralympic sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet.
The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. It was developed in the United States in the 1960s, became a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and eventually was featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014. Its popularity (as measured by equipment sales) in the United States peaked in 2007 and has been in a decline since.</p>
<h2>Snowboarding Styles</h2>
<pre>
<h4>1. Jibbing: </h4>"Jibbing" is the term for technical riding on non-standard surfaces, which usually 
includes performing tricks. The word "jib" is both a noun and a verb, depending on the 
usage of the word. As a noun: a jib includes metal rails, boxes, benches, concrete 
ledges, walls, vehicles, rocks and logs. As a verb: to jib is referring to the action of 
jumping, sliding or riding on top of objects other than snow. It is directly influenced by 
grinding a skateboard. Jibbing is a freestyle snowboarding technique of riding. Typically 
jibbing occurs in a snowboard resort park but can also be done in urban environments.
<h4>2. Freeriding:</h4>Freeriding is a style without a set of governing rules or set course, typically on natural, 
un-groomed terrain. The basic allows for various snowboarding styles in a fluid motion 
and spontaneity through naturally rugged terrain. It can be similar to freestyle with the 
exception that no man-made features are utilized. See also Backcountry snowboarding.
<h4>3. Freestyle Snowboarding:</h4>Freestyle snowboarding is any riding that includes performing tricks. In freestyle, the 
rider utilizes natural and man-made features such as rails, jumps, boxes, and innume-
-rable others to perform tricks. It is a popular all-inclusive concept that distinguishes the 
creative aspects of snowboarding, in contrast to a style like alpine snowboarding.
<h4>4. Slopestyle:</h4>Competitors perform tricks while descending a course, moving around, over, across, 
up, or down terrain features. The course is full of obstacles including boxes, rails, 
jumps, jibs, or anything else the board or rider can slide across. Slopestyle is a judged 
even and winning a slopestyle contest usually comes from successfully executing the 
most difficult line in the terrain park while having a smooth flowing line of difficult, 
mistake-free tricks performed on the obstacles. However, overall impression and style 
can play factor in winning a slopestyle contest and the rider who lands the hardest tricks 
will not always win over the rider who lands easier tricks on more difficult paths.
<h4>5. Half-pipe:</h4>The half-pipe is a semi-circular ditch dug into the mountain or purpose-built ramp made 
up of snow, with walls between 8 and 23 feet (7.0 m). Competitors perform tricks while 
going from one side to the other and while in the air above the sides of the pipe.
<h4>6. Boardercross:</h4>Boardercross, also known as "Boarder X" and "Snowboard X", is a very popular but 
relatively recent winter sport, starting in the 1980s and earning its place as an official 
Winter Olympic sport in the 2006 Turin games. In Boardercross, several riders (usually 
4 to 6)race down a course similar to a motorcycle motocross track (with jumps, berms 
and other obstacles constructed out of snow on a downhill course). Unlike traditional 
head-to-head races, competitors use the same terrain, sometimes resulting in accidental 
collisions.
