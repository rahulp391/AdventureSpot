<p style="Font-size:26px;">Bungee jumping is an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord.The tall structure <br> is usually a fixed object,such as a building,bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object,such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter, hat has the ability to hover above the ground.The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound.When the person jumps,the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the cord recoils,and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated.</p>
<h2>Variations</h2><pre><h4>1. Catapult:</h4>In "Catapult" the 'jumper' starts on the ground. The jumper is secured and the cord 
is stretched, then released and shooting the jumper up into the air. This is often
achieved using either a crane or a hoist attached to a (semi-)perma structure. This
simplifies the action of stretching the cord and later lowering the participant to 
the ground.<h4>2. Trampoline:</h4>"Bungy Trampoline" uses, as its name suggests, elements from bungy and trampol-
-ining. The participant begins on a trampoline and is fitted into a body harness, 
which is attached via bungy cords to two high poles on eitherside of the trampoline.
As they begin to jump, the bungy cords are tightened, allowing a higher jump than 
could normally be made from a trampoline alone.<h4>3. Running:</h4>"Bungee Running" involves no jumping as such.It merely consists of, as the name
suggests,running along a track (often inflatable) with a bungee cord attached. One 
often has a velcro-backed marker that marks how far the runner got before the
bungee cord pulled back. This activity can often be found at fairs and carnivals
and is often most popular with children.<h4>4. Ramp:</h4>Bungee jumping off a ramp. Two rubber cords – the "bungees" – are tied around the
participant's waist to a harness. Those bungee cords are linked to steel cables along
which they can slide due to stainless pulleys. The participants bicycle, sled or ski 
before jumping.<h4>5. Scad diving:</h4>SCAD diving (Suspended Catch Air Device) is similar to bungee jumping in that the
participant is dropped from a height, but in this variation there is no cord;instead the 
participant free falls into a net.
