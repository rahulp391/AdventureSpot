<p style="Font-size:26px;">Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba), which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater.Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.Although the use of compressed air is common, a new mixture called enriched air (Nitrox) has been gaining popularity due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intake during repetitive dives.</p>
<h2>Scuba Diving Types</h2>
<pre>
<h4>1. Open Water Diving: </h4>The first type of scuba diving that all certified scuba divers can do is open water diving. 
Open water diving is the start of your scuba diving discovery journey.When you enter 
the open seas and oceans around the world, you're privileged to see amazing
 underwater animals like the turtle in the above image.
<h4>2. Drift Diving:</h4>A Drift dive is a scuba dive in waters where there's a tide or current flowing that's strong 
enough to push you along in the water. You go with the flow!.It's the equivalent of flying,
but you're underwater and weightless. It's an effortless scuba dive and can be a lot of 
fun.There are additional training aspects to a drift dive. Plus you'll need additional 
scuba diving equipment too.
<h4>3. Underwater Navigator:</h4>The best thing about scuba diving is experiencing no gravity. You can somersault, stand 
on your head, and swim upside down if you want to. The drawback is that this you can 
quickly lose your sense of direction in this new world. Being able to find your way back 
to the boat is essential to every dive, making increased navigation skills a good idea for 
any diver.
<h4>4. Deep Diver:</h4>As a beginner diver, you’re advised to stay shallower than 18 meters/60 feet. Want to 
explore deeper? The PADI Deep Diver course is for you. During the course, you’ll 
experience what happens on a dive in deeper water, like changes in color and the 
effects of increased pressure.
<h4>5. Night Diver:</h4>Why limit your dive time to just daylight hours? Dusk and dawn offer the opportunity to 
see animal behavior not seen during the day. Many creatures come out of their hiding 
places under the cover of darkness. Before you do a night dive on your own, check out 
the PADI Night Diver course. You’ll learn tricks for communicating with your flashlight 
and other important techniques for night diving.<pre>
